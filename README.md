# Network Visualization Tool

This project is an early-stage mockup of a network visualization tool. The goal is to create an interactive interface for visualizing and managing network nodes and their connections.

## Features

- **Interactive Nodes**: Nodes can be added, moved, and deleted.
- **Connection Visualization**: Connections between nodes are displayed using SVG lines.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes.

This file contains the HTML structure and inline CSS for the mockup. Key elements include:

- **Toolbar**: Contains buttons for adding nodes, showing connections, deleting nodes, and toggling the theme.
- **Network Container**: Holds the SVG element for connection lines and the div elements for nodes.
- **Example Nodes**: Predefined nodes (Router, PC 1, Server) with draggable functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open

## Future Plans

- Implement backend logic for saving and loading network configurations.
- Add more node types and customizable properties.
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive features.
